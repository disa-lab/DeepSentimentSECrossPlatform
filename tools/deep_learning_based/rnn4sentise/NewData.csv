,The method returns false if the stream wishes for the calling code to wait for the drain event to be emitted before continuing to write additional data and true otherwise.,Neutral
,"It is quite possible that the stream is not draining, and calls to the event are just buffering chunks and returning false.",Neutral

,The general idea would be to centralize shared state at (or near) the root component of your app via a context provider and then wrap child components that need access to the shared state via the corresponding context consumer.,Neutral
,Create a context for shared state.,Neutral
,"Create a context which gives us a state ""provider"" and a state ""consumer"".",Neutral
,The context consumer will be used to access and interact with shared state throughout the app.,Neutral
,Define state access for shared state in root component.,Neutral
,"Next, define get/set logic for the shared state.",Neutral
,This should be defined in state at (or near) the root level of your app.,Neutral

,I used papaParse library to have the CSV file parsed and have the key-value pairs(key/header/first row of CSV file-value).,Neutral
,"In Java a List/Array or any object has a reference, mean that Java stores them in the same memory cell.",Neutral
,"So when you pass the object String to function addItems(), a reference still keeps for this object.",Neutral
,And any change for the object inside the function will be affected by the variable because it stores in the same memory cell.,Neutral
,"In the other hand, plusOne() receive param in primitive type (int/ long/ double), and it does not have a reference.",Neutral
,So any change inside the function will not be affected.,Neutral
,"If you change plusOne(Integer num) instead of (int num) and send the param √≠ Integer, you will see the difference.",Neutral
,XLSX and CSV are extremely different file formats so I'm not surprised in the least that the file size has practically doubled.,Neutral
,"XLSX files are XML based, CSV is just text with no compression.",Neutral
,"Take any XSLX file, change the extension to .ZIP and then open it, you can see the difference and you'll also notice that as a ZIP file, it opens, therefore, it's compressed.",Neutral
,"Also, there's no direct correlation between the size of an XLSX file and what it converts to when saved as a CSV.",Neutral
,"To append elements in a linked list, there are two cases that you need to consider.",Neutral
,Linked list is empty or Linked list has at least one node.,Neutral
,"If it is empty, we assign head to the new node.",Neutral
,"In addition, we keep track of the current node.",Neutral
,"This way, we always have a pointer to the last node and will not need to iterate through when we append more values.",Neutral
,"Now for the case where there are items already in the linked list, we set the current node's pointer to the new node.",Neutral
,"For both cases, we must move the pointer to the next node.",Neutral
