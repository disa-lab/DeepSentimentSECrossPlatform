10004,@DrabJay: excellent suggestion! Code changed. :-)
10005,Any decent browser should protect against malicious code in images so I don't think you'll have to worry. If you're truly concerned you can use a combination of getimagesize() and see about using a ClamAV extension/program to scan files for malicious code. Nothing is perfect though.

10031,"I assume you're using Ken Reitz's excellent requests library to do the HTTP requests (if not, you really should be!)Most likely, the problem is that requests doesn't add a 'Content-type' header to multi-part uploads, and packmgr doesn't read multi-part bodies with no 'Content-type' header. So, while a normal 'requests' POST of a multipart-encoded file would go something like this: you instead have to use the longer form, setting an explicit content-type: Note that one side-effect of doing it this way is that it cannot stream the file - the entire package ZIP file will be read into memory."

Click the triangle and select ""Flame Chart"". Once you are in Flame Chart mode, you can zoom and pan to see the digest cycles, how long they take, and exactly what functions are being called. The Flame Chart is so incredibly useful for tracking down page load issues, ng-repeat performance problems, digest cycle problems!

It has 0 entropy, but makes absolutely terrible predictions on any testing distribution that isn't a purely non-random sequence, assigning 0 probability to events that actually happen."

10162,The first line sets the file name variables and sets the field separator to comma. The second line sets the output field separator to comma too. The third line prints lines with 3 fields to the new file; the fourth line prints lines with other than 3 fields to the error file.Note that your code would be excruciatingly slow on big files because it executes two processes per line. This code has only one process operating on the whole file which will be really important if the input grow to thousand or millions or more lines.

One justified, one centered. Then clip the justified one.HTML CSS Fiddle.Of course, the above code is hard-coded for the specific width. Again, you'll probably need JS in order to compute the number of lines in the div.

Now make changes in your code to work accordingly with ZF2 as most of the things will stop working once to move to ZF2.However, I would suggest don't migrate to ZF2 just for the sake of upgrading, migrate only if you dont have any other choice.

To do that, it looks up all the information it needs for an invocation from the object itself at run time.By contrast, your C++ code is probably early-bound, which means offsets into the COM object's vtable are compiled directly into your code.

10275,"I just use following code right now. The table is MyISAM 90MB. terms has FULLTEXT INDEX and it is varchar(255). There are 1,000,000 rows on the table. I wonder if there is any solution which is more resource usage friendly than fulltext search on MySQL? Especially in terms of memory. By saying solution, I refer to any solution such as other types of databases, table structures etc. and if the solution would be adaptable to a standart VPS or hosting in general, it would be extremely super duper perfect!

Is there any way for me to keep all my work, but also revert to a situation where I can just rebase FeatureC on to Feature B?"

10278,"I've been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model, builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong. The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model, surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic."

10280,Link works fine!
10281,"If you are on 11g you are in Luck :-) you can Use SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED in the Cursor - then you are guaranteed that two threads will never get the same row on a fetch!The RIGHT WAY to do this in Oracle would be Advanced Queueing - since this will solve ALL YOUR PROBLEMS, provides synchronization und parallel execution and other benefits...Before Oracle 11 and without Advanced Queuing (if you really want to code it yourself...) You can do it like this:(The bits marked with autonomous transaction have to be called in a separate method as an autonomous transaction. If the Update returns 0 Rows it can either be because the table is empty, or because two threads accessed the same row. - So we need a separate ending condition counting available rows."

So for example, a User could have an associated EmailLogin (with an email/password), or they could have many (or none). Similarly they could have 0..* associated OpenIDLogin credentials. Are there any existing authentication libraries for Rails which use this method? Alternatively, is this a really terrible idea?"

While these tasks are running, we show the ActionBar's refresh spinner and animate it. The problem is: onCreate and onResume are executed before is, so at the point where we start the task, the refresh spinner doesn't even exist. Hence, it won't animate. I don't see any simple way around this. I guess we could keep the information about a task being spawned in onCreate, and as soon as the ActionBar becomes available, update it accordingly.

Unfortunately, I use MongoDB (not redis), and the cost of adding another database to my stack would be prohibitively high. I tried using the module, but it absolutely killed my servers (huge CPU usage). Is there any other way to share the socket.io session between EC2 servers?"

I'd wager, your swap will take at least 100 to 200 cycles, probably more, but that heavily depends on the numbers you are swapping (how many mispredictions are made)."

You can remove the file afterward. The option is actually set in: C:\Documents and Settings[user]\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\VisualStudio[version]\browser.xml However, if you modify the file directly while VS is running, VS will overwrite it with your previous option on next run. Also, if you edit the default in VS you won't have to worry about getting the schema right, so the work-around dummy file is probably the easiest way."

I've managed to pin down most bugs, but the bugs I'm having the most trouble with tend to have a common theme. All of them seem to be to do with the screen refreshing, redrawing or updating to match provided data. This is a pain to debug, because I can't break on every refresh, and most of this stuff is time-sensitive, so breakpoints occasionally ""fix"" the bug.

By inaccurate, I mean the actual delay time seems to vary by 250-500ms more or less. Although this isn't a huge amount of time, when using it to hide/show UI elements the time can be visibly noticeable. Are there any tricks that can be done to ensure that performs accurately (without resorting to an external API) or is this a lost cause?"

12927,We're in the process of packaging combinations of our products/modules. Some of them are stand-alone some are interdependent. All versions must be deployable side-by-side. As it is we're considering two choices: One MSI per package and version One MSI per product/module and version The first alternative would mean that combinations of the same merge modules would be delivered in several packages. The second alternative represents the simpler path. Can you give some advice on the subject? Will any of the alternatives cause grief in the longer run?

12938,"The reason to build it into the language is that it can get painful when you want a hierarchy of chainable objects that return the most derived type. Currently, you have to have `` generics to allow subclasses to change the return type so calling methods don't lose scope of the object they are calling. Building into the jvm removes this ugliness. Plus, instead of a return statement, it can just push a reference to this on the stack as needed; an ""on demand return"" instead of an ""always return"" that can be hard to optimize out when you don't use it."

I evaluated it quite a bit last year and really liked it although in the end we deployed TFS2008 and so we're using TeamBuild to get a lot of the integration goodness.

I am guessing if I let WSS assign a port number to the new web application surely this can never be accessed externally unless I open the assigned port? Cheers

Boost adds a significant compile time overhead, had tons of files to park into your repository (and to have to copy around/zip/extract if you are making an archive). That's the reason I try not to use it. I know you can choose what files to include/not include, but you usually don't want to have to worry about Boost's cross dependencies with itself so you just copy the whole thing around."

14208,What are you trying to sort? Is there any reason not to use: I'm sure this uses QuickSort and you don't have to worry about making any coding errors. You can implement IComparable to change what you want to sort on. If all your data doesn't fit in memory... well the you're off to the races with Merge sort or something along those lines.
14209,"You've said ""For the sole purpose of reporting"". Does this mean that the data is pulled into Oracle from some other system. If so, this would mean the design would not need to worry overly about normalization for update/integrity purposes."

14214,"This is a great question.. my approach for solving this question would be to ask: Given a list of items, what is the popability of choosing two consecutive items from the list which are sorted. As the list becomes more sorted, the probability will approach 100%. To calculate this probability is relatively simple: I hope this helps!"
14215,"I have ci, so our staging environment builds itself. Should I have a script that not only builds production but does all the branching for it as well? When you have 1 code base on 2 different urls with skinning, should they be required to build at once?"

Regardless, in the Enqueue, send args with NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Add, the item added, and Count-1 as the index. In the Dequeue, send args with NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Remove, the item removed, and index 0."

There are no build events on the solution property page, so what should I do? I'm guessing that I can add tasks to the msbuild file but I'm afraid I don't understand the relationship between VS and msbuild at all. Does VS execute msbuild with the SLN file?"

14235,I think using RSA encryption for anything but key transport is abuse. Generate a new key for a symmetric cipher and encrypt your bulk data with that. Then encrypt the key with RSA. Send the symmetrically-encrypted cipher-text along with the asymmetrically-encrypted content encryption key to your recipient.

14242,"Not really, no. I basically just took JaredPar's word for it that the threadID would be reasonably stable, used this during testing, and then changed the interface to react to OnMouseMove events instead for the final deployment. I didn't do that originally because it means passing events up through a whole chain of Controls and is generally just a pain in the ass. It is, however, more reliable than the above method, which only failed once or twice during the whole of testing, but did fail."
14243,"@Pax, from my personal experience, somehow I always get faster and more reliable results when I'm using tables. But every time I did that, I feel guilty."

14297,"Yup many hours later I found that a single panel that was wrapped around the section had a EnableViewState=""false"" added to it. Sad part is that I know I didn't add that because I didn't even know what it was until craig here mentioned it. Visual Studio must have added it sometime."
