342,OrtuJIRA_test_0,planning to fix this.. I am planning to remember completed containers (only id) at node manager for predefined time (10min).

407,OrtuJIRA_test_0,Sorry I narrowed down the issue to Chrome's over-zealous caching. I was able to reproduce the problem on two separate computers in a simple project where I had upgraded from Wicket 1.4.0 to 1.4.15. But due to testing before and after Chrome had cached the buggy version of wicket-ajax.js from 1.4.0 and did not detect that it changed with the update.

424,OrtuJIRA_test_0,Hmm.  Breaking #if($query.foo) compatibility isn't ok if we can't find a reasonable way to keep that and the sub then i'll ditch the sub.   But i much prefer $query.foo.bar over $query.get('foo.bar') so i'm not going to give that up quickly.  The type conversion suffixes are more than just nice since the main point of the ValueParser is to parse values.  If you don't care about type conversion then you may as well just put the source map into the context.  Anyway i'm going to see if i can make both work somehow.  If i can't then expect me to resurrect the sub in a later version where complete backwards compatibility isn't necessary.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,-1.0,-1.0,,0,-1,0.0,0.0,,1.0,0.0,,1,1

443,OrtuJIRA_test_0,Hi  I was going to join in on reporting this problem. I had recently downloaded a build from 10/17/2005 in order to fix a problem I was experiencing with jscookmenu.

461,OrtuJIRA_test_0,I'm still not in love with the sarcasm or excessive negativity.  I'll just point a few things out.  1/ I didn't veto anything and this has nothing to do with C++.  I think it is a bad idea for us to generate code in a way that causes semantics to silently change when a new optional field is added.  This in dangerous in the long term.  2/ I have no problem reverting this change.  3/ Restoring the old constructor and marking in deprecated is probably a good idea.,1,-1.0,-1.0,,0,-1.0,-1.0,,0,0,-1.0,-1.0,,1,1,1.0,-1.0,,-1.0,-1.0,,-1,-1

OTOH they probably  care more about successfully migrating their 1.0.2 app to 1.1 and this is just getting in the way.

510,OrtuJIRA_test_0,bq. Actually DIH started as a standalone webapp inside AOL. We changed it because we didn't want to duplicate the schema in two places and also because we wanted to have it available by default in Solr installations.  Another web app means you need to procure hardware plan capacity/failover create firewall holes etc  Even if it were a standalone app I would still run it on the same hardware that runs Solr though I might run it on the secondary servers that aren't normally seeing query load.  Why would you need to have the schema in two places?  My DIH config doesn't mention any field names because all Solr field names match the MySQL field names.  Even if they didn't I'm not sure why it would be any different than any other SolrJ client which doesn't need to have a copy of the schema.  bq.

Otherwise concepts like lazy-loading norms and all this other stuff get pushed onto the sim which is an awkward place (imagine if you have many fields).

Double-counting is bad -- it can lead to a bad user experience. There's something about """"lower"""" that I feel makes it slightly better than """"upper"""" but I can't really explain the rationale. I don't think there's any point in compliance with legacy if nobody depended on the behavior (they couldn't specify the behavior before either).  Just because its easy to set the include doesn't mean the default is arbitrary.  Any way if the default remains to double-count I'm going to insist that my readers for the second edition of my book change this value.""",0,-1.0,-1.0,,0,-1.0,0.0,,0,0,1.0,-1.0,,-1,-1,0.0,-1.0,,-1.0,-1.0,,-1,-1

534,OrtuJIRA_test_0,Hi Guillaume  I think that what you are saying is right and i find ( despite is on the specification or not ) that to have the error status is quite useful.  But i don't agree that if InOnly MEP terminate with an ERROR status it should propagated back.  I agree totally with Gianfranco this should be done only when we're working in sync mode otherwise it's better not  to propagate the error back and use feature like restart from the failure point that we've just implemeted.

Some clarifications: # MR1 JT kills all running tasks on a TT when it's deemed 'lost'. # It also kills all completed maps on that TT for 'active' jobs. # The tasks are marked KILLED rather than FAILED and thus don't count towards the job which is correct since it wasn't the job's fault.

I'm gonna hold off on LUCENE-2771 until we figure this one out... because it would make your getSequentialSubReaders in the synced=true case quite heavy (without modifications).

574,OrtuJIRA_test_0,Sorry for the late review. Have a few minor questions/comments.  60. What happens if have 2 instances of Consumers with the same clientid in the same jvm? Does one of them fail because it fails to register metrics? Ditto for Producers.  61. ConsumerTopicStats: What if a topic is named AllTopics? We use to handle this by adding a - in topic specific stats.  62. ZookeeperConsumerConnector: Do we need to validate groupid?  63. ClientId: Does the clientid length need to be different from topic length?  64. AbstractFetcherThread: When building a fetch request do we need to pass in brokerInfo as part of the client id? BrokerInfo contains the source broker info and the fetch requests are always made to the source broker.,-1,-1.0,0.0,,-1,-1.0,0.0,,0,1,-1.0,0.0,,0,-1,0.0,-1.0,,1.0,-1.0,,-1,-1

596,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Sumeet we did it purposely because if the proxy services are dynamically loaded then we need to build those services at the runtime and redeploy them which is a little bit risky on a production environment. Also there is no mechanism to check whether a particular proxy definition is updated in the registry or not because this configuration is used only at the startup.  We can add this functionality to load the proxy services only at the startup time from the registry (this doesn't mean they are dynamic) but I don't see any value there. If you could explain a bit about your exact requirement I might be able to provide an alternative to this.  Thanks Ruwan,1,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,1,1,0.0,0.0,,0,1,0.0,1.0,,0.0,-1.0,,1,1

656,OrtuJIRA_test_1,[~bikassaha] Thanks for the heads-up Bikas! This JIRA is not concerned with the Tez integration for Pig and is simply the abstraction in Pig to allow for alternate ExecutionEngines in Pig. But will certainly change this on the Tez integration side of stuff.  Thanks a lot [~cheolsoo] for continuing this! I think everything looks good from my end. I can certainly see why we may want to keep this on a different branch until everything is finalized. Certain things may still need more work. For example OutputStats is not completed abstracted out as it still has references to POStore which is a MR implementation construct. ScriptState/PPNL/JobStats may still need more abstraction (especially PPNL) and reworking to incorporate a new ExecutionEngine abstraction. I think what we have done here is the minimum foundation for an abstraction though and it would be appropriate to put into trunk but these are not my decisions to make.   With regard to public methods that were changed I don't think most of them are a big deal besides as Cheolsoo said the PigServer throwing PigException. I never thought IOException was a good exception to throw but I think reverting PigServer back to IOException as it is userfacing code is not a big deal. The rest of the method signature changes shouldn't be worrisome because most of them are internal to the project.   However the change from JobStats to MRJobStats while necessary (as each ExecutionEngine would have it's own type of JobStats it would present to the end user) could be problematic because it is userfacing code and would probably break people who were previously using JobStats. That I think is the most important thing to keep in mind. The task of making the PPNL and JobStats clearly tied to the ExecutionEngine should be thought through also.,1,1.0,1.0,,1,1.0,0.0,,1,1,0.0,0.0,,0,1,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,0,0

673,OrtuJIRA_test_1,bq. Though pig itself compiled fine and is ready to go the contrib projects (owlzebrapiggybank/hiverc) didnt compile I think because either it didn't download dependices of those projects or didn't include them in the build path.  Ashutosh yes. I did realize it and as you rightly guessed it is because the ivy-dependency list doesn't have some jars that are actually being used by contrib packages. This is not an issue related to eclipse-classpath. However there has to be a JIRA opened to solve this issue of downloading the missing jars by ivy.   Can you please file a JIRA for this?

699,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Hi Michael thank you for your answer. I thought that it would not be so easy to solve this issue. Unfortunately.  I agree with you that the main problem here is that a copy action is missing and I guess AttachStrategy.persist is the right place to add some kind of copy functionality.  I started looking into the source code of the enhanced class from the test. PersistenceCapable declares a public method to copy fields (pcCopyFields(...)). Unfortunately you can't use in AttachStrategy.persist because the entity to persist has no statemanager at this point (an exception InvalidStateException will be the result).  My suggestion is to modify the class enhancement and remove the StateManager check in pcCopyFields (I don't see the need for this check).  Afterwards you can use pcCopyFields in AttachStrategy.persist by adding something like      ...         if (manager.getCopyNew()) {             int[] fields = new int[meta.getFields().length],1,1.0,0.0,,1,-1.0,0.0,,0,-1,0.0,0.0,,1,1,0.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,0,0

I have already created some enumeration into DemoPosData.xml but it is still not been used. There are still a lot of things that has been not implemented or not working so contribution from other people are welcome. Removing the hardcoded value pos-1 into WebPosEvents.java at line 77 is something still to be done.

734,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Yes I have been watching OFBIZ-1453 with interest.  I approve of the issue and implementation and didn't have anything to add so I haven't been involved.  The thing I have been thinking about is that there's some assumptions to be made here for pricing and the type of question.  I.e. multiselect questions should display the absolute price.

I have spend some time reviewing the patch which I find quite elegant.   Some improvements to the patch would be  - make NutchDocument implement VersionedWritable instead of writable and delegate version checking to superclass - refactor getDetails() methods in HitDetailer to Searcher (it is not likely that a class would implement Searcher but not HitDetailer) - use Searcher delete HitDetailer and SearchBean  - Rename XXXBean classes so that they do not include """"bean"""". (I think it is confusing to have bean objects that have non-trivial functionality) - refactor LuceneSearchBean.VERSION to RPCSearchBean - remove unrelated changes from the patch.(the changes in NGramProfile HTMLLanguageParserLanguageIdentifier... correct me if i'm wrong)  As far as i can see we do not need any metadata for Solr backend and only need StoreIndex and Vector options for lucene backend so i think we can simplify NutchDocument#metadata.

I believe this was due to the fact that the job files were on the classpath instead of all of the dependency jars. Adding the job files to the classpath does not add the dependency jars they contain to the classpath as well.

I've never used it how does it work? {quote}  when you're running bin/mahout in the context of a build the -core option is used to tell it to use the build classpath instead of the classpath used for a binary release.

If we merge that way of thinking with what I'm currently working on (having a configurable """"MAHOUT_CONF_DIR"""" which is used for all these props files) we could just have the mahout shell script just add MAHOUT_CONF_DIR to the classpath (the way you already have it adding the hardwired core/src/main/resources directory) and then it would work that way. {quote}  Yep that should do it as long as MAHOUT_CONF_DIR appears before src/main/resources we should be good to go.

804,OrtuJIRA_test_1,From the dev list didn't want to lose this background (or make Uwe type it again <G>)  The idea was to maybe replace RAMDirectory by a âcloneâ¿ of MMapDirectory that uses large DirectByteBuffers outside the JVM heap. The current RAMDirectory is very limited (buffersize hardcoded to 8 KB if you have a 50 Gigabyte Index in this RAMDirectory your GC simply drives crazy â we investigated this several times for customers. RAMDirectory was in fact several times slower than a simple disk-based MMapDir). Also the locking on the RAMFile class is horrible as for large indexes you have to change buffer several times when seeking/reading/â¦ which does heavily locking. In contrast MMapDir is completely lock-free!   Until there is no replacement we will not remove it but the current RAMDirectory is not useable for large indexes. Thatâs a limitation and the design of this class does not support anything else. Itâs currently unfixable and instead of putting work into fixing it the time should be spent in working on a new ByteBuffer-based RAMDir with larger blocs/blocs that merge or IOContext helping to calculate the file size before writing it (e.g. when triggering a merge you know the approximate size of the file before so you can allocate a buffer thatâs better than 8 Kilobytes). Also directByteBuffer helps to make GC happy as the RAMdir is outside JVM heap.....  RAMdir uses more time for switching buffers than reading the data. The problem is that MMapDir does not support *writing* and that why we plan to improve this. Have you tried MMapDir for read access in comparison to RAMDirectory for a larger index it outperforms several times (depending on OS and if file data is in FS cache already). The new directory will simply mimic the MMapIndexInput add MMapIndexOutput but not based on a mmapped buffer instead a in-memory (Direct)ByteBuffer (outside or inside JVM heap â both will be supported). This simplifies code a lot.   The discussions about the limitations of crappy RAMDirectory were discussed on conferences sorry. We did *not*decide to remove it (without a patch/replacement). The whole âmessageâ¿ on the issue was that RAMDirectory is a bad idea. The recommended approach at the moment to handle large in-ram directories would be to use a tmpfs on Linux/Solaris and use MMapDir on top (for larger indexes). The MMap would then directly map the RAM of the underlying tmpfs.....,0,-1.0,0.0,,0,-1.0,0.0,,0,0,-1.0,0.0,,0,-1,-1.0,-1.0,,0.0,0.0,,-1,-1

843,OrtuJIRA_test_1,I did nothing special. My understanding was that simply trying to test under JDeveloper caused the problem. Your report says removing xmlparserv2 causes JDeveloper not to start.  Is there something else I need to do to cause the problem?  FYI - I created a Maven project with the code above as the only application. I then imported the application which was a bit frustrating as it didn't seem to accomplish much. I then had to manually add the log4j 2 jars into the classpath along with target/classes and had to make a couple of other changes so that it knew how things were laid out in the project.

848,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Thanks for getting started on this. I have a couple of requests -  1. Could you please upload a patch to this JIRA and grant it to Apache ?  2. This patch doesn't apply cleanly to trunk would you mind updating a patch that would ?   It will make it much easier for us to review it.

849,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Hi ShengTao you would think if you follow:  1. Check if the service is there add if it is not. 2. Then add a bindingTemplate.  Then you would not be overwriting a bindingTemplates. You are right though if you are saving a service it will overwrite the existing one and it will remove any bindingTemplates if they are there. The current behavior is how the UDDI v3 spec tells us to so it but we could add a config option to differentiate from the spec.  Please let me know if you are following the above strategy and *still* seeing issues.   --Kurt,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,1.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0

861,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Stefan  > the said method is not public since it returns *all* workspace names regardless of user rights. please note that > the a session must only see/know about workspaces it is actually allowed to access.   I'm working on a garbage collector for the data store. The GC doesn't care about user rights or putting it another way it must be able to access all workspaces. Ideally I'd like to use a SystemSession but you can't get one outside RepositoryImpl or o.a.j.c package (i.e. getSystemSession(String) is package private WorkspaceInfo is protected). I understand that these APIs shouldn't be public but they're useful from within the core. In my case for the GC. I'm very interested in using another way to walk every workspace but this other way should guarantee that the repository won't shutdown during a walk operation. I'll check the solution Thomas said he'll be proposing but in the mean time that is what I'm using. Still I don't see why this APIs aren't public.

884,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Oleg  I agree it does seem that the presence of the Proxy-Authorization header on the already authenticated connection causes re-authentication.  So for NTLM to work the proxy-auth header must be removed once authenticated.  I don't think either patch 2 or 3 handles this case unless (in the case of patch 2) the host also uses NTLM.  What we really need is a way to remove NTLM headers after the authentication has succeeded.  Mike,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,-1,1.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,1.0,0.0,,0,0

924,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Todd I briefly looked at the patch. It looks like you are trying to get rid of the Journal Spool in BN. Correct me if I am wrong. I don't think you can.

946,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Hi Lars sorry about the delay in responding. Good point about the TreeMap always returning result in a deterministic ordering. The patch itself I think is still beneficial because it removes a little bit of redundancy in the existing equality code. IMO the fix makes it easier to understand as well. In addition the tests are beneficial since we were missing coverage there.

972,OrtuJIRA_test_1,It'd work but it's a halfway hack to the real fix we should do in 0.92.  My points is that I think it is a good idea in general to raise this timeout (while adding configs so you don't necessarily have to wait since smallish clusters could use the max param if they want to speed this up)... we have run into the situation where not all RS came in the 3 second window (which really is too small given heartbeat frequency) so I've already ramped up the config timeout for fb production.

975,OrtuJIRA_test_1,So there is another thing here by deferring the evictions to the background thread you increase the chance that the block will be tenured then it must be collected from CMS space thus radically increasing the GC complexity of the cache.

987,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Yes bytes + comparator would work fine for jaql.  Preferably it would be the same comparators that are already used by the sort code which work on serialized bytes (but also on WritableComparables so that might be a problem).  If these comparators are inconsistent then the sort in map/reduce will not work properly.  I think it is ok to document the transitivity requirement but I don't see how you can enforce it in any way.  Different key types are fine as long as the comparator knows how to handle them.  If you can't reuse the same comparator interface I can always implement my comparisons in another place but I already have two of them (one in the WritableComparable and one in the Comparator).  I don't see how column families and the key comparator are related except that they are both table-level metadata. Yes I agree that a single comparator would be used for the entire table.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,1.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,1,1

It looks like code is duplicated. Now our vm makes check after parsing and only if -Xverify is on.

The above isn't complete (it needs e.g. 'read()' and 'seek()' implementations) but it looks like a good start.  But the real question is to you: could you use the above?  Can you present the data and checksums as input streams that support read(byte[] int int) and seek(long)?  It also assumes a particular checksum implementation CRC32.

1077,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Hello   Sure you are right here I didn't make myself clear enough Im sorry.  As you (and RFC959) say when we are sending the file we should transform to NVT-ASCII but not when we are receiving the file. In this second case i think that the expected behaviour is that the text message be written to a file with the default line separator for the platform.          The sender converts the data from an internal character             representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII             representation (see the Telnet specification).  The receiver             will convert the data from the standard form to his own             internal form.   Actually  according to the spec before a RETR ASCII operation is transformed we should be converting the charset to ASCII  for our machine could be using EBCDIC  to store files and clients are supposed to expect that files are encoded in NVT-ASCII.  So I don't know ... Any way this has little priority for me (until someone using a non-ascii-compatible encoding complains) so we could leave this for the future. Any way I don't like ASCII mode for it breaks  the 'REST' command. My implementation only supports binary mode.,-1,-1.0,-1.0,,-1,-1.0,0.0,,-1,0,-1.0,-1.0,,0,-1,0.0,-1.0,,-1.0,-1.0,,-1,-1

1109,OrtuJIRA_test_1,I think my first preference  would be to make this only a java 7 and up feature. The change is very clear and we can use our normal testing methods.  Meanwhile users can set their umask appropriately.  My second preference would be only  to only change permissions by default  with java 7 and higher. I think we really need to have tests for the default configuration and non-portable tests might have to be customized to different environments which seems like a lot of effort for something that won't be used moving forward.  I am sorry I didn't chime in earlier.  Time has been quite tight recently.,-1,-1.0,-1.0,,-1,-1.0,-1.0,,-1,0,1.0,-1.0,,1,-1,-1.0,-1.0,,0.0,0.0,,-1,-1
1110,OrtuJIRA_test_1,I think clearing private fields should work in all JVMs since that's what the call to f.setAccessible(true) is for. Those fields were final too before DERBY-23 and it looks like modifying final fields via reflection didn't work prior to Java 5 even when calling setAccessible() first.

1122,OrtuJIRA_test_1,Thanks for accepting this patch. I'm sorry I wasn't sensitive to the brace convention already in the file. I probably could have javadoc'd the inner class too :)  I didn't think about the lack of thread safety of the SimpleDateFormat class: good catch. So this counts as a bugfix by markt (format was being used in an unsynchronized way prior to this patch) as well as an enhancement by me :)  If DBCP typically uses localized error messages I'd be happy to provide another patch that localizes the exception's message.,-1,1.0,1.0,,1,1.0,1.0,,1,1,1.0,1.0,,1,-1,1.0,1.0,,-1.0,1.0,,-1,-1

Just for the Hive handler please look at the (cas-support-simple-hive) branch - https://github.com/milliondreams/hive/tree/cas-support-simple-hive  All the test cases (whatever few they had) pass there and it is working perfectly with Thrift/Compact storage Column Families.,-1,-1.0,-1.0,,-1,-1.0,-1.0,,-1,1,1.0,0.0,,1,-1,0.0,-1.0,,-1.0,-1.0,,-1,-1

1178,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Release Candidate 1 of this patch.  This patch contains: + add IP Address to CrawlDatum Version 5 (as byte[4])  + a IpAddress Resolver (map runnable) tool to lookup the IP's multithreaded + add a property to define if the IpAddress Resolver should be started as a part of the crawlDb update tool to update the parseoutput folder (contains CrawlDatum Status Linked) of a segment before updating the crawlDb. + using cached IP during Generation  Please review this patch and give me any improvement suggestion I think this is a very important issue since it helps to do _real_ whole web crawls and not end up in a honey pot after some fetch iterations.

1186,OrtuJIRA_test_2,"""Bertrand - nice work. This is a great idea and the patch looks good overall. Couple of points:  - Don't forget the Apache header on the new Errors class - Maybe do the grammar corrections on the counter error messages separately? Just so we keep the commits to a single issue each.  - I'm not sure we need to retain the delegating """"formatValueList"""" method in TestDriver. Something to discuss...   As for using Guava to do the string join - I know MRUnit used to have it as a dependency but this was removed in MRUNIT-50. Probably not worth bringing it back for such a simple method.

1245,OrtuJIRA_test_2,"""Thanks Dawid.  bq. Yes this is pretty much the top-n nodes reordering that I did albeit without any optimization of how many n to take (the hardcoded magic constants should probably be justified somehow? Or replaced by a default in FST somewhere?).  bq. Deciding how many nodes to reorder is I think hard â I failed to provide any sensible fast heuristic for that and I simply do a simulated annealing to find a local optimum.  Yeah the algo is simplistic now... and it does force caller to pick the params (though minInCountDeref=3 and maxDerefNodes=Inf are probably pretty good)... we can and should make it more sophisticated over time.  We have at least one spare bit to still use in the arc flags :)  bq. One thing I was wondering is why you decided to integrate the packer with the fst â wouldn't it be cleaner to separate packing from construction? Granted this requires a double pass over the fst nodes and more intermediate memory but it wouldn't add any more complexity to the builder which is already ehm a bit complex . You can compare this design in Morfologik:  Well... it's tricky.  First I decided to change node targets to ords so that pack could use an array to (relatively!) efficiently hold node data eg inCount newAddress etc.  That required making the first pass FST """"modal"""" (deref'd or not).  If we didn't do this then the packer would have to use even less RAM efficient data structures (eg Map<IntX>) I think?  Second the format written by the packer is tightly coupled with the FST reading ie there are sizable differences when reading packed vs unpacked FST.  But I agree it'd be cleaner if we could move packing out (eg Util.pack) and more strongly decouple packing from FST format...  One thing I'd really like to somehow do is create different classes for FST writing vs reading and different classes for each format.  We now have write-ord write-non-ord read-packed read-unpacked (and even the two readers have 3 different modes depending on INPUT_TYPE).

1249,OrtuJIRA_test_2,"""{quote} I don't really know much about NamedSPILoader but I think what you're suggesting. How would we support Factories loading unrelated classes like they can through ResourceLoader now? Assume they're on the classpath and use Class.forName? {quote}  It needs more discussion (and input from Uwe would help!) but it works like Charset.forName(""""ASCII"""") etc. We use this already for codecs and postingsformats (Codec.forName Codec.listAllCodecs ...).  Have a look at lucene/core/src/resources/META-INF/services for the idea. Basically you """"register"""" your classes in your jar file this way: additional jar files (e.g. look at lucene/test-framework/src/resources/META-INF) can load more classes.  So this could support some idea like TokenizerFactory.forName(""""Whitespace"""") or something simple like that. So someone would not need to use org.apache.solr.analysis.xxx namespace to be able to load their analyzer stuff easily they use whatever package they want and register in their META_INF. And added jar files (other analysis jars) are automatically available this way.  I think Uwe mentioned this idea before though I think he had Analyzers in mind (e.g. provide language code and get back analyzer or something). Anyway thats for another issue :)  Just something worth consideration if we want to make these modules really pluggable. On the other hand we shouldn't use anything overkill if its not the right fit... """,1,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,1,1.0,1.0,,1.0,-1.0,,1,1

I'm not sure you need a separate SearcherHolder class - can't you re-use IndexReader's decRef/incRef?

I think there are some thread safety issues..  this is weird - on my dev machine and in the patch it is not synchronized.. on the machine I run the tests it is. Anyway you are right.

1270,OrtuJIRA_test_2,"""1. My feeling is that """"if (file.lastModified() < now + ACCESS_TIME_RESOLUTION)"""" is not necessary since the lastModified value will already be truncated to the system resolution but I do not think it is harmful.  2. I chose to throw exception only if file.canWrite because I was trying to minimise the impact of the change. It's not clear to me whether setLastModified might work when !file.canWrite. However it certainly must work (because of GC) if file.canWrite. I would consider moving the canWrite test outside of the setLastModified call similar to getRecordIfStored it just wasn't necessary to fix the immediate problem.  3. Well not swallowed exactly but caught and converted to failure return code (-1) e.g. see BLOBInDataStore.getSize.

1297,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I found the reason why we observe different behaviors with the network server: Since you run with the default security manager you actually get derby.system.home set as a system property as a side effect (see line ca line 586 in NetworkServerControl.java) as part of the set-up of the security manager. I ran without the security manager so I did not get it set.   I do think though that the old behavior was buggy: I can't see why one should need to set derby.system.home explicitly to get the auto-boot behavior.

1315,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Noah said heâs going to fix this in his build-fauxton branch but Iâd like to explain this for posterity.  make indeed throws this error I didnât suggest it is a grunt.js error but itâs the way we use Autotools. In particular in how we use Autotools for packaging. Each file that is supposed to end up in our final apache-couchdb-x.y.z.tar.gz tarball needs to be marked as such in a Makefile.am. For Fauxton that means we maintain a list of Fauxton files in src/Makefila.am specified as `FAUXTON_FILES`:  FAUXTON_FILES = \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/assets/less/activetasks.less \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/base.js \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/resources.js \     â¦and so on  In that list there is a line: `fauxton/app/initialize.js` e.g. where we say that file is supposed to go into the release tarball. That file however does not exist at the time `make dist` is run so make complains. I assume the solution is that make needs to call grunt at some point to turn fauxton/app/initialize.underscore into fauxton/app/initialize.js and I think that is what Noah is doing in his branch. I just wanted to explain why this isnât a make error.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,-1.0,0.0,,0,0,-1.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,-1.0,0.0,,-1,-1

1329,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Well since you didn't respond to my request I finally did without and checked out what you did.   First of all looking at CIncludeTransformer I have to say that I don't understand why it is doing its own caching. Caching should be the concern of pipelines and sources. If you want preemptive loading of cached content this would much better be implemented as a Source wrapper. In fact we now have such a class in the scratchpad area.  One unpleasant implication of the current design is that as an unsuspecting user of this class when you turn on caching in this transformer the cached contents of any included cocoon:// source that identifies a caching pipeline would be cached twice! Once by the pipeline itself and once by the CIncludeTransformer.  Now concerning your patch. I don't quite understand why you retain the validity of the cached contents. The algorithm the caching pipeline uses to determine the validity of the cached contents is as follows: first it looks at the validity of the cached pipeline contents itself then if the validity by itself indicates it needs a current validity to check against then the pipeline contructs a pipeline validity by calling the participating components' getValidity() methods. If your component now returns the same validity object that you previously returned then  that does not make much sense to me.  Since I really needed this functionality myself and I didn't have enough time to discuss and refactor the CIncludeTransformer I implemented my own very basic IncludeTransformer that does exactly what I need no more no less. I'll post it here if anyone want to use it.  I also looked at the XIncludeTransformer to see if I could implement caching in that one instead. But it seems that the XIncludeTransformer reads included content from URL objects instead of from Source objects.,0,-1.0,0.0,,0,-1.0,0.0,,0,0,-1.0,0.0,,0,-1,-1.0,-1.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0

With the lack of an undo feature the only reasonable thing for me to do is a revert the datamap.  4) I think my font changed for labels.  I'll have to verify that.

In any case fixing the build is pretty trivial the changes made to ModificationStatement should just be reverted (and we should just pass the CL in argument to executeWithCondition() to SP.cas()).  Other than that: * I believe we now refuse CL.SERIAL for the cas() method (because CL.blockfor() throw an UnsupportedOperationException for SERIAL). Maybe we can make SERIAL mean """"wait for nothing on commit not even a local one"""" (which probably amount to making CL.blockfor() return 0 for SERIAL and adding a 'if' in WriteResponseHandler ctor to signal right away if blockfor is 0). * I don't think CL.ANY will really work as for normal writes since we don't generate hints for commit.

1377,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Truth is that the sheer size of CFStore (over 2K line) annoys me. I think this prove CFStore has too much things in it and we messed up at encapsulation. So I tried to make DataTracker be about dealing with the memtables and sstables as much as possible. And being able to have View not leak from DataTracker sound like a proof that we do have some encapsulation there. I'm not claiming it's perfect but I really don't think that CFStore is our most beautiful class in there and I do believe that DataTracker improves this a bit.  But there is a good part of subjectivity in all this anyway. And if people really don't like the move of the bits of querying in there fine I'd move them back in CFStore and leak the View from DataTracker. I would however be more reluctant to remove DataTracker altogether and put the AtomicReference in CFStore. Because this would move all the CAS related logic in CFStore and seriously there is already too much stuff in CFStore.

1612,OrtuJIRA_test_2,What you can do is trying this request with a different browser when the server is suppose to hang and also try to do another request when the serveur is supposed to be hang to see if it's not a pb with the PDU length ( what I suspect is that when trying to decode this request the decoder is waiting for more bytes so wait ad vitam aeternam ...) I gonna try to implement the decoding of this PDU as a test case just to check.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,-1.0,,-1.0,0.0,,-1,-1
1613,OrtuJIRA_test_2,The search result entry requests does not return the correct DN because it use the internal representation (byte[]) instead of using the user provided value which contains escaped values.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
1614,OrtuJIRA_test_2,Here we have two options : 1) work with the internal value but escape all the special chars 2) work with the stored UP value.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,1.0,0.0,,1,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
1615,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I think the bnest solution is (2) because the UP value is supposed to be valid - it has successfully been parsed when the first request arrived -.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,1.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1.0,,0,0
1616,OrtuJIRA_test_2,This will impact two parts : - searchResultEntry - all the response that contains a LdapResult and which returns a MatchedDN.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
1617,OrtuJIRA_test_2,I already have a fix for the first request but the question is : which version will integrate this modification ?,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0

1818,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Hi   Iâm trying to use hive performance benchmark. I read README file and followed step by step and finally I reached to the  data generation part. Teragen has no problem but I face a problem with htmlgen.  I configured something to my own cluster (40 VMs) and launched generateData.py  but it never finished! I launched it about 10 hours ago..  So I modified UserVisits and Rankings in config.txt to be smaller but it was also failed. Even it consumed very little resources when I saw 'top' information in the ubuntu.  Have you guys ever met this kinds of problems?  And if you have how did you solve this problem?  Thank you so much,1,-1.0,0.0,,0,1.0,1.0,,0,0,-1.0,-1.0,,0,1,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,0,0

1851,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Thanks a ton for your review Todd. Here's an updated patch which addresses all of your comments except the following.  bq. In EditLogFileInputStream why do we need to pass isInProgress as a boolean? If it's in-progress that means we don't know the lastTxId so it would be INVALID_TXID right? So we can implement isInProgress() by just comparing lastTxId.  Because in the case of pre-transactional ELFIS we pass in INVALID_TXID even though the log is not yet in progress.  I'm still working on producing an updated patch which also adds testing for the pending DN message queues.,1,1.0,0.0,,1,1.0,0.0,,1,1,1.0,0.0,,0,1,0.0,1.0,,1.0,-1.0,,0,0

1869,OrtuJIRA_test_3,Hi Ted Matteo  Thanks for the review.  The commands.rb has some existing logic that tries to 'rescue' some exceptions. It will get more and more difficult to keep it generic artificially as we evolve and add more ... The approach to expand (instead of shrink) this logic is not a bad or ugly one ...  But your suggested solution is fine.,1,1.0,-1.0,,1,0.0,0.0,,0,0,-1.0,-1.0,,0,1,-1.0,-1.0,,0.0,0.0,,1,1

If not how to deprecate the old? + The annotations look interesting.  Could their serializations be used in other contexts the shell say?  Or -- warning -> crazy-thought coming -- somehow producing thrift IDL? + In hadoop/hbase line lengths are < 80 chars (Your new classes are missing apache license classes are missing comments describing what class is about etc). + Is there anything we could do refactoring HTable say so your modeling was easier?

2451,OrtuJIRA_test_4,"""Thanks Tucu! You are right. I had not thought of that.  I'm on the fence because we are serializing a process which should happen fast (so parallelizing is good). Like you already mentioned  bq. 1* Add a method in the FileSystem to disable its shutdown hook. MRAppMaster would disable it and call closeAll() explicitly (it already does). This is already present (by setting conf.setBoolean(""""fs.automatic.close"""" false) ) So I'm not sure what problem this JIRA is fixing. Or are we planning for the future? I'm fine with the latter answer being yes. I'm just curious.  The patch looks good for what it intends to do although the latest one doesn't include the fixes you made in response to Nicholas' comments.""",1,1.0,1.0,,1,1.0,1.0,,1,0,1.0,0.0,,1,1,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1,1

2989,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi Jurgen yes that's probably a good idea but not something that can be easily and/or quickly implemented.

2999,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Patch applied. Thanks a lot especially for the test case. http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=240459&view=rev http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=240461&view=rev  The result for 180 and -180 is definitely wrong. There's a bug that needs to be fixed eventually. But since this is low-priority for me I'm going to leave it for now. I've added a comment to the new test case block-container4a that explains what is wrong. So I think I'll close this issue. It's primarily for the patch after all and the bug won't be missed now that there is a check in our test suite. If anyone disagrees just reopen the issue or create a new one.,1,1.0,0.0,,1,-1.0,0.0,,1,1,-1.0,-1.0,,0,1,0.0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,,1,1

3002,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I think you should get rid of the open-ended version spec [1.2) as it occasionally screws things up by bringing in snapshots or non-working code. Otherwise to my eyes it looks good.,1,0.0,0.0,,0,1.0,1.0,,1,0,0.0,1.0,,0,1,0.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,1,1

3006,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I took a quick look at D (unused locals).  Most of it looks good but I don't understand the few places where for backward compatibility there is what looks like a useless statement just to make sure a property gets read.

3009,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Agreed the current behavior is incorrect I just didn't want you disappointed. :-)  If you create your singleton jira patch before this one is applied then just include them together and close this bug.  I agree that commit rights would make this simpler and supplying patches is the primary way to gain commit rights so you are on the right path regardless what happens with Pax Web. :-),1,1.0,1.0,,0,0.0,1.0,,0,0,1.0,1.0,,0,0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,-1.0,,0,0

3014,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thank you for the source code but why don't you also attach a diff file you get by running 'svn diff'?  It will help us figure out which part is changed exactly.

3019,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi Tiago  Thanks for looking at this issue.  On visual inspection of the change your text change looks fine. However I can't apply the patch. You need to svn diff from the top of the tree show it shows the path staring with java/engine/...  You should reopen the issue until it has been committed.  Also just for good measure you should run suites.All and derbyall  in case there are any canon updates needed.  Thanks  Kathey,1,1.0,1.0,,1,1.0,1.0,,1,1,1.0,0.0,,1,1,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1,1

3023,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks for double-checking the fix Knut. I am thinking of merging the fix into 10.3 tomorrow just to make sure that tests run fine on the tinderbox. All the tests ran fine on my machine.,1,1.0,1.0,,1,1.0,1.0,,1,0,1.0,0.0,,0,1,0.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1,1
3024,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi Manjula I think your approach basically looks good. Please see my comments below.  1) I think this code  +        NetworkServerControl serverControl = null,1,1.0,1.0,,1,1.0,1.0,,1,0,0.0,1.0,,1,0,0.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,,1,1

3029,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks Bryan for converting these tests.  In using the DERBY-2152 conversion tool can you double check that it does not omit  the fail assert method after a method call in a try-catch block when the statement is expected to fail.  e.g. instead of   try {   s.execute(command),1,1.0,0.0,,1,1.0,0.0,,1,1,-1.0,0.0,,0,1,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,1,1

3031,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi Ramin  The patch looks good except I think it would be good to give import/export its own  SQLState starting with XIE instead of reusing the existing store FILE_EXISTS message.  Also it would be good to have test cases for writing the lob files.  Kathey,1,1.0,0.0,,1,1.0,0.0,,1,-1,1.0,1.0,,1,1,0.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,0,0
3032,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Knut Anders thanks for the review and the good advice.  The attached patch rmTestPreparedStatementMethods_v2.diff should address your comments.,1,1.0,1.0,,1,1.0,1.0,,1,1,1.0,1.0,,1,1,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1,1

3036,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi Anurag  Thanks for the preliminary peek at this patch. Looks good. I like the way you handled the optional inclusion of the JDBC4-specific classes in the jar file. I recommend adding class and method comments to the test classes so that reviewers will know what these tests are supposed to stress. Thanks for the explanation of why you disabled the SecurityManager and for commenting the property file accordingly. When we do commit this patch let's leave the JIRA open to remind us to re-enable the SecurityManager after mustang fixes its bug.  Cheers-Rick,1,1.0,1.0,,1,1.0,1.0,,1,0,1.0,1.0,,1,1,0.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1,1
3037,OrtuJIRA_test_5,The patch looks good and the tests ran cleanly. I reindented some parts of the code since they had twice as much indentation as the surrounding code (does your editor use tab width eight instead of four?).  Committed revision 396859.,1,1.0,0.0,,1,1.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,1,0.0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,,1,1

3044,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Hi Aki  I strongly suggest you write a persistence system test both for client and server side which can expose the problem you mentioned and also verify your fix works.  Actually we already have ServerPersistenceTest and ClientPersistenceTest in systests/ws-specs I think you can add yours in those two classes.  Btw your suggestion seems ok for me.

3047,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I've now ported the fix to 2.0.4 and deployed  a new snapshot.   Could someone give it a try to make sure it really is fixed so that we can close this off for 2.0.4?  Thanks!,1,1.0,1.0,,1,1.0,1.0,,1,1,1.0,1.0,,1,1,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1,1

3298,OrtuJIRA_test_5,And then MarkupCache uses that interface to checkout what the actual file is  I dont think we will get IResourceStream implementation that are not File or URL and if we do then we fallback on the cachekey only approache.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3299,OrtuJIRA_test_5,It seems to work fine for me when i test locally the markup is only created once per fixed location and then access through  cachekey -> locationstring -> markup  So if locationString doesn't work we get this:  cachekey -> cachekey -> markup  But i guess that is a very small percentage if there is even 1 on this planet...  should we include this into 1.3.2?,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,1.0,1.0,,0,-1,-1.0,0.0,,-1.0,0.0,,0,0

3317,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I will post my results when the tests finish.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,-1.0,,0,0
3318,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I have some comments on the new patch:  PermDescriptor  o You should remove the permUUID field from this class since it shadows the oid field in the superclass.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3319,OrtuJIRA_test_5,In my experience this kind of shadowing always causes bugs in the future because it is so easy to lose track of which copy of the redundant field is being used.,0,0.0,-1.0,,0,0.0,-1.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,-1,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1.0,,1,1
3320,OrtuJIRA_test_5,"So the constructor for this class should call setUUID( permUUID ) rather than stuffing the shadowing field via ""this.permUUID = permUUID"".",0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3321,OrtuJIRA_test_5,o Once you do that you can get rid of the getUUID() setUUID() and getObjectID() methods in this class.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1.0,,0,0
3322,OrtuJIRA_test_5,o I have reservations about the second constructor for this class (the one which is used to create a key descriptor rather than a full-fledged permissions descriptor).,0,-1.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3323,OrtuJIRA_test_5,However I see that you are following the data dictionary patterns for the other permissions descriptors.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3324,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I think you are right to follow the existing patterns.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1.0,,0,0
3325,OrtuJIRA_test_5,But we should put a sticky note on our brains to remind ourselves to clean up this pattern in the future--partially initialized data is brittle.,0,0.0,-1.0,,-1,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3326,OrtuJIRA_test_5,This is something we can revisit when we collapse all of the permissions catalogs into the master catalog which you are creating.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3327,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Don't worry that's another project and not part of the sequence generator work.,0,1.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,-1.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3328,OrtuJIRA_test_5,SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory  o I think that you should flip the order of the keys in the second index.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3329,OrtuJIRA_test_5,That is the key order should be ( schemaID sequenceName ) rather than ( sequenceName schemaID ).,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3330,OrtuJIRA_test_5,This will speed up the check in DataDictionaryImpl.isSchemaEmpty().,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3331,OrtuJIRA_test_5,But maybe you have a use for an index with key order ( sequenceName schemaID ) which I'm not seeing.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3332,OrtuJIRA_test_5,If so then I would recommend adding a third index.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3333,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Note that if you swap the key order then you will need to make a corresponding change to DataDictionaryImpl.getSequenceDescriptor(String SchemaDescriptor)   o I think that buildColumnList() should return an array of 10 column descriptors one for each column in the table.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3334,OrtuJIRA_test_5,See for instance the corresponding method in SYSALIASESRowFactory.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3335,OrtuJIRA_test_5,SYSROLESRowFactory  o As with SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory I think that buildColumnList() should return a larger array one cell for each column in the table.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1.0,,0,0
3336,OrtuJIRA_test_5,DataDictionary  o The header comment for getPermDescriptor() does not seem to describe the method.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3337,OrtuJIRA_test_5,EmptyDictionary  o I think that you can remove the stub for dropSequenceDescriptor(String TransactionController) because you have removed this method from the DataDictionary interface.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3338,OrtuJIRA_test_5,DataDictionaryImpl  o The header comments on getUncachedPermDescriptor() getPermDescriptor() and dropAllPermDescriptors() look like they were copied from pre-existing methods so they should be revised to describe the new methods.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
3339,OrtuJIRA_test_5,Thanks -Rick,0,1.0,1.0,,1,1.0,1.0,,1,1,1.0,1.0,,1,1,0.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1,1

3387,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I've only switched the ComponentColorElement (which was the ComponentColorProperty) over to use the new configuration so far but I'll switch the other elements over to using the new configuration next.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,-1.0,,0,0
3388,OrtuJIRA_test_5,In the new version elements have two methods - render() which draws them and apply() which  initialises shared properties like colour.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0

3420,OrtuJIRA_test_5,The attached patch fixes two problems:   * the first one which happen when the class is loaded from the boot classloader (in which case we now use the system classloader to load the enclosing class)   * the second one which is the fact that all kind of linkage errors can happen when loading the class and this would really disturb the classloader correct behavior,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,-1.0,0.0,,0,0,-1.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,-1,-1

3422,OrtuJIRA_test_5,A potentially legitimate use case of a {{set}} without an {{apply}} is a builder class that should not be accessed until the building is complete at which point the internal state will be accessed directly to produce the final result of some type.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0

3452,OrtuJIRA_test_5,I guess the obvious thing to do is to go in and reconfigure the pagination so it doesn't (paginate) but if we had the ability to add items to existing POs then you could still use the pagination mechanism and build up the PO page-by-page (quite handy if your working through  your POs during less busy times of the day).,0,1.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,1.0,0.0,,0,0

3534,OrtuJIRA_test_6,"""> Have checked in this change which can be reviewed here: http://fisheye6.atlassian.com/changelog/click/?cs=766349  > Would appreciate any feedback.  I just have the feeling this entire ControlRegistry is growing over our heads. Taking a look at many older applications with older Click releases I can't stop thinking that Click was very good for years without it. I also received a few custom components for maintenance and I don't think this change (nor ControlRegistry) is of any needed in them (or maybe simply I'm not getting the entire concept).  Of course I'm a newbie but my impression is that most of the advantages you list are for ClickClick. Is it possible that the problem is with the ClickClick  approach(and that should be changed) not with Click?  Many parts of Click are simple to understand and nice but this one is not. Making it even more complex is just a guarantee that users like me will understand it even less.  From what I saw one of the most important parts of Click is backward compatibility. For this however Click should remain very simple otherwise it will get big and bloated(and it can't afford """"published"""" experiments). Tapestry on the other and can do this since with every new version they throw aboard the entire compatibility so """"experiments"""" if go wrong are not that a problem - and history shows that complex things always go wrong sooner or later (latest one: with T5.2 they'll trow maven away now :) )  My wish is when I look at the Click source code to be able to quickly understand what's up there - cause only so I have a good feeling when I use it  in applications (otherwise I have that """"black box feeling"""" - and it's not fun ).  I think like this are most users - those who prefer complex thing have a very huge choice of concurrent frameworks :). """,1,1.0,1.0,,0,1.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,1,1.0,1.0,,1.0,-1.0,,-1,-1

3559,OrtuJIRA_test_6,{quote} Totally didn't know we support IN for DELETE.   Would prefer to fix by offering IN for for the other statements as well. The Antlr doesn't look too daunting w/ DELETE as an example (knock on wood). Can take a stab at that tomorrow. {quote}  This is {{multiget_slice()}} / {{multiget_count()}} and was intentionally omitted (remember?).  Not saying this is decision that can't be revisited just reminding.

3570,OrtuJIRA_test_6,I'll look into the namespace handler. Thanks.  Yes I should have added the different event handling support to the TODO above. I need to think more about this and look into the camel code a bit more. Using just the endpoint api I couldn't create routes on the fly hence the polling consumer approach.  I'll keep hacking away at in in my toolbox when customer needs dictate.  Am I missing something in your approach how would I do this then in the XML DSL using your approach?  I think virtual routing is a known limitation of Camel when you start to deploy large scale systems. Out of curiosity have you seen camel ever been deployed with 1000's of routes (and/or routes files)? I think this would have FD and thread overkill problems. Everything repeats itself :),1,0.0,0.0,,1,0.0,1.0,,0,0,1.0,0.0,,0,1,0.0,1.0,,0.0,-1.0,,1,1

3584,OrtuJIRA_test_6,Thanks Ivan. I'll do the changes by just return if it matches as you suggested. I'll investigate it later.  bq.Auditor will be a top level daemon so it should own its create it's own LedgerManagers and ZooKeeper client. The only thing passed in to is should be the configuration.  Anyway we are planning to have initialization class which does starting Auditor and RW threads. Would you agree to create ledgerManagers there and pass it to the Auditor and RW daemons?  In that case shall I keep the ctor as it is.

4437,OrtuJIRA_test_7,If regionnames were made of tablename+endrow instead of tablename+startrow then in the metatables doing a search for the region that contains the wanted row we'd just have to open a scanner using passed row and the first row found by the scan would be that of the region we need (If offlined parent we'd have to scan to the next row).,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0

4444,OrtuJIRA_test_7,If we had this in place I think it would help with the migration to this new way of doing the meta because as is the region name in fs is a hash of regionname... changing the format of the regionname would mean we generate a different hash... so we'd need hbase-2531 to be in place before we could do this change.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1.0,,0,0

4497,OrtuJIRA_test_7,Our APIs should be of course be general enough that it's possible to incorporate different serialization systems and different file formats but we needn't provide implementations of all combinations of these but should rather direct folks towards a primary implementation.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0

4885,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Murray that is exactly what I am proposing - having a separate org.apache.jspwiki.api -package and placing a number of existing manager classes into it as interfaces.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
4886,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Or to be precise a mostly equivalent set of APIs JCR requires some modifications which would make it complicated to support the existing set of APIs - mainly because we need to carry state information in a WikiContext which the old API signatures do not mostly support.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0

4888,OrtuJIRA_test_8,The idea behind this is largely the same as with our existing package structure - there is nothing technical in preventing *everything* to be in the org.apache.jspwiki -namespace (with no subpackages) but both aesthetics and experience tell us that it just makes sense to add subpackages to make class management easier.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
4889,OrtuJIRA_test_8,In the same vein isolating the API interfaces into a separate package makes it a lot easier to manage than having everything dispersed around - e.g.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0

4891,OrtuJIRA_test_8,If the developer wants to know whether he is using any possibly unstable components all he needs to do is to glance at the set of import statements on the top - if he's using other classes than org.apache.jspwiki.api.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0

4959,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Here's another crack at this:  1) The default behavior for Derby is the current behavior with all of its security holes for java routines.,0,0.0,1.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0

4962,OrtuJIRA_test_8,3) If you do opt-in then you get the SQL standard behavior:     3a) Jar ids are mandatory.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
4963,OrtuJIRA_test_8,Instead to access methods in the JRE you have to include little wrapper methods in your jar files that you loaded into the database.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
4964,OrtuJIRA_test_8,3c) The search order for customer-written routines is SQL standard: First we look in the jar file where the routine lives.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,-1.0,,0,0

4972,OrtuJIRA_test_8,In the wiki next to each one of these parameters it explicitly says that reducing this parameter will decrease memory usage this is why we reduced these parameters (it did not mention the filterCache at all).,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,-1.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0

5075,OrtuJIRA_test_8,My assumption is that when you make a request to read 1k from a disk file that the OS reads substantially more than 1k from the disk and places it in the buffer cache.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
5076,OrtuJIRA_test_8,(The cost of randomly reading 1k is nearly the same as randomly reading 100k--both are dominated by seek.),0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,-1,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
5077,OrtuJIRA_test_8,So if you make another request to read 1k shortly thereafter you'll get it from the buffer cache and the incremental cost will be that of making a system call.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
5078,OrtuJIRA_test_8,In general one should thus rely on the buffer cache and read-ahead and make input buffers only big enough so that system call overhead is insignificant.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,-1,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,-1,-1
5079,OrtuJIRA_test_8,An alternate strategy is to not trust the buffer cache and read-ahead but rather to make your buffers large enough so that transfer time dominates seeks.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
5080,OrtuJIRA_test_8,This can require 1MB or larger buffers so isn't always practical.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,-1.0,,0,0
5081,OrtuJIRA_test_8,So back to your statement a 1k buffer doesn't save physical i/o but nor should it incur extra physical i/o.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0

5150,OrtuJIRA_test_8,I guess the gen stamp is unnecessary but the DN isn't going to automatically mlock newly appended data so the NN needs to somehow realize that the cached length is shorter than the new length and ask the DN to recache at the new length.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,-1.0,0.0,,0,0

5657,OrtuJIRA_test_9,I used to have the subset of in-memory partitions maintained as a sliding window (i.e.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0
5658,OrtuJIRA_test_9,most recently computed K partitions) but I switched to the model with K-1 partitions always in memory and 1 slot for loading out-of-core partitions because it made the logic slightly simpler.,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0,0

One justified, one centered. Then clip the justified one.HTML CSS Fiddle.Of course, the above code is hard-coded for the specific width.
